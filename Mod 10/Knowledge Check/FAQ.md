## What are some reason to use automation to provision resources?
There are several reasons to use automation to provision resources:

**Speed and efficiency**: Automation can help speed up the process of provisioning resources by reducing the time it takes to manually provision and configure infrastructure components. This can help improve efficiency and reduce the time-to-market for applications.

**Consistency and repeatability**: Automation ensures that resources are provisioned consistently and to the same specifications every time. This helps to avoid configuration drift and ensures that applications and services are deployed with the same settings across different environments.

**Cost savings**: Automation can help reduce costs by ensuring that resources are only provisioned when needed, and that they are automatically shut down when they are no longer required. This can help avoid unnecessary costs associated with idle resources.

**Reduced risk of human error**: Automation can help reduce the risk of human error, which can lead to misconfigurations and security vulnerabilities. By automating the provisioning process, you can ensure that resources are provisioned and configured correctly every time.

**Scalability**: Automation can help you scale resources up or down based on demand, ensuring that you have the resources you need to handle increased traffic or workload.

**Compliance**: Automation can help ensure that resources are provisioned in compliance with regulatory and security requirements, reducing the risk of non-compliance.

Overall, using automation to provision resources can help **improve efficiency**, **reduce costs**, and **increase the reliability** and **security of your applications and services**.
